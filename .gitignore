#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the Python version is
#   usually handled by the user. Everything else can be ignored.

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if you are having issues with lock file conflicts,
#   you can remain in sync by committing the Pipfile and ignoring the Pipfile.lock.
# Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
